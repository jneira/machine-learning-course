* Prioritzing What to Work On
* Error analysis
  - start with a simply and quick algorithm
  - plot learning curves
  - error analysis: manually examine the examples to extract patterns
* Error metrics for skewed classes
  - skewed: extreme ratio +/- examples
  - precision=true positives/predicted positives=
              true positives/true pos+false pos
  - recall=true positives/actual positive=
           true positives/true pos+false neg
* Data For Machine Learning
  - Amount data more important than algorithm performance. Assuming:
    - Feature x has sufficient information to predict y
    - Test useful
    - Very complex functions -> low bias
    - Very large training set -> low variance
